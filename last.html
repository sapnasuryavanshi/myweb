HTML is an evolving language, and each new version is given a number. The first definitive version was
HTML 2.0 -- this had most of the elements we know and love, but was missing some of the Netscape/ Microsoft
extensions, and did not support tables, or ALIGN attributes.
HTML 3 (late 1995) was an ambitious effort on the part of Dave Raggett to upgrade the features and utility of
HTML. However, it was never completed or implemented, although many features were integrated in the next
"official" version of HTML, known as HTML 3.2.
HTML 3.2 was the next official version, integrating support for TABLES, image, heading and other element
ALIGN attributes, and a few other finicky details. Essentially all browsers understand HTML 3.2. IT was,
however, missing some of the Netscape/Microsoft extensions, such as FRAMEs, EMBED and APPLET.
Support for these (after a fashion) came in HTML 4.0
HTML 4.01 is the current official standard. It includes support for most of the proprietary extensions, plus
support for extra features (Internationalized documents, support for Cascading Style Sheets, extra TABLE,
FORM, and JavaScript enhancements), that are not universally supported.<br>
The &ltp&gt tag defines a paragraph.
The p element automatically creates some space before and after itself. The space is automatically applied by
the browser, or you can specify it in a style sheet.<br>

			Standard Attributes
The p  tag supports the following standard attributes:
			<table border="2px solid">
			 <tr>
			<td>
			<b class="heading">Attribute</b>
			</td>
			<td>value</td>
			<td>Description</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>class
			</td>
			<td>class name
			</td>
			<td>Specifies a classname for an element
			</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
